=============

Simple 4x4 Slide Puzzle Application using Actionscript 3.

Movieclips (Instance names):
- box1, box2,..., box16               //main objects
- shadow1, shadow2,..., shadow16      //3D effect when the box is pressed

Buttons (Instance Names):
- startButton
- button1, button2,..., button16

guide:
- Open a new Actionscript 3 file.
- Create 16 boxes and arrange it as how 4x4 slide puzzle looks like.
- Create a shadow image for Pressed effect, and put it (dupicate it into 16 shadows) on each boxes. 1 shadow for 1 box. 
  Make sure that the size of your shadow and your box is the same size.
- Create an invisible button (I use a square shape lines). Duplicate it into 16 buttons and put each button on every shadow.
- Create a start button.
- Follow the Instance names that I've mentioned before.
- Copy Paste the codes into the Actions frame.
- Run the flash file.

Thanks & enjoy!
